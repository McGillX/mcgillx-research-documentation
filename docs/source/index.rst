Getting Started
===============

If you are hosting courses on edx.org, before starting the setup consult with edX to setup keys and credentials for data transfer.

The McGillX Research Platform (moocx) is underdevelopment. At present it will assist in both setup of mongo databases as well as the generation of a handfull of report types. The workflow outlined in this documentation outlines how to download and decrypt data from edX, install the moocx python package, and setup a mongo database.
